# PM-Warehouse
A warehouse program with discounts, receipts and proof of purchases

The warehouse project was a school project and it was based on C# and MySQL with constant connection between the software and the database.
The idea was to create finished product which any warehouse company or system can use with discounts, invoices and adding, updating or creating new products.
